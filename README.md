## About this project

This project is based on fullstackhero, I put the webapi and blazor projects together.  
Most of my jobs are creating blog, adding UnitOfWorkRepository and improving DapperRepository.
I had read an article "Dapper, Entity Framework and Hybrid Apps" which written by Julie Lerman, and learn the concept of " Using Dapper for all queries and EF for all saving", I believe it is a good idea for DDD and CleanArchitecture
